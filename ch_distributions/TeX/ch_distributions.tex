\section{Normal distribution}
\label{normalDist}

\index{distribution!normal|(}

Among all the distributions we see in practice,
one is overwhelmingly the most common.
The symmetric, unimodal, bell curve is ubiquitous
throughout statistics.
Indeed it is so common, that people often know it as the
\term{normal curve} or
\termsub{normal distribution}{distribution!normal},\footnote{It
  is also introduced as the Gaussian distribution after Frederic
  Gauss, the first person to formalize its mathematical
  expression.}
shown in Figure~\ref{simpleNormal}.
Variables such as SAT scores and heights of US adult males
closely follow the normal distribution.

\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{ch_distributions/figures/simpleNormal/simpleNormal}
\caption{A normal curve.}
\label{simpleNormal}
\end{figure}

\begin{onebox}{Normal distribution facts}
  Many variables are nearly normal, but none are exactly normal.
  Thus the normal distribution, while not perfect for any single
  problem, is very useful for a variety of problems.
  We will use it in data exploration and to solve important
  problems in statistics.
\end{onebox}


\subsection{Normal distribution model}

The normal distribution always describes a symmetric, unimodal,
bell-shaped curve.
However, these curves can look different depending on the
details of the model.
Specifically, the normal distribution model can be adjusted
using two parameters: mean and standard deviation.
As you can probably guess, changing the mean shifts the bell
curve to the left or right, while changing the standard deviation
stretches or constricts the curve.
Figure~\ref{twoSampleNormals} shows the normal distribution
with mean $0$ and standard deviation $1$ in the left panel
and the normal distributions with mean $19$ and standard
deviation $4$ in the right panel.
Figure~\ref{twoSampleNormalsStacked} shows these distributions
on the same axis.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \Figure{0.85}{twoSampleNormals}
  \caption{Both curves represent the normal distribution.
      However, they differ in their center and spread.
      The normal distribution with mean 0 and standard
      deviation 1 is called the
      \term{standard normal distribution}.}
  \label{twoSampleNormals}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \Figure{0.6}{twoSampleNormalsStacked}
  \caption{The normal models shown in
      Figure~\ref{twoSampleNormals} but plotted together
      and on the same scale.}
  \label{twoSampleNormalsStacked}
\end{figure}

If a normal distribution has mean $\mu$ and standard deviation
$\sigma$, we may write the distribution as $N(\mu, \sigma)$.
The two distributions in Figure~\ref{twoSampleNormalsStacked}
may be written as
\begin{align*}
N(\mu=0,\sigma=1)
  \quad \text{and} \quad
  N(\mu=19,\sigma=4)
\end{align*}
Because the mean and standard deviation describe a normal
distribution exactly, they are called the distribution's
\termsub{parameters}{parameter}.

\subsection{Standardizing with Z-scores}

\noindent%
\Add{We often want to put data onto a standardized scale,
which can make comparisons more reasonable.}

\newcommand{\satsd}{200}
\newcommand{\actmean}{21}
\newcommand{\actsd}{6}
\newcommand{\annsatscore}{1300}
\newcommand{\annsatzscore}{1}
\newcommand{\tomsatscore}{24}
\newcommand{\tomsatzscore}{0.5}

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{Table~\vref{satACTstats} shows the mean
    and standard deviation for total scores on the SAT and ACT.
    The distribution of SAT and ACT scores are both nearly normal.
    Suppose Ann scored \annsatscore{} on her SAT and Tom scored
    \tomsatscore{} on his ACT.
    Who performed better?}
  \label{actSAT}%
  We use the standard deviation as a guide.
  Ann is \annsatzscore{} standard deviation above average
  on the SAT: $\satmean{} + \satsd{} = \annsatscore{}$.
  Tom is \tomsatzscore{} standard deviations above the mean
  on the ACT:
  $\actmean{} + \tomsatzscore{} \times \actsd{} = \tomsatscore{}$.
  In Figure~\ref{satActNormals}, we can see that Ann tends
  to do better with respect to everyone else than Tom did,
  so her score was better.
\end{nexample}
\end{examplewrap}

  \caption{Ann's and Tom's scores shown with the distributions
      of SAT and ACT scores.}
  \label{satActNormals}
\end{figure}

Example~\ref{actSAT} used a standardization technique called
a Z-score, a method most commonly employed for nearly normal
observations but that may be used with any distribution.
The \term{Z-score}\index{Z@$Z$} of an observation is defined
as the number of standard deviations it falls above or below
the mean.
If the observation is one standard deviation above the mean,
its Z-score is~1.
If it is 1.5 standard deviations \emph{below} the mean,
then its Z-score is -1.5.
If $x$ is an observation from a distribution $N(\mu, \sigma)$,
we define the Z-score mathematically as
\begin{align*}
Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
\end{align*}
Using $\mu_{SAT} = \satmean{}$, $\sigma_{SAT} = \satsd{}$,
and $x_{_{\text{Ann}}} = \annsatscore{}$, we find Ann's Z-score:
\begin{align*}
Z_{_{\text{Ann}}}
  = \frac{x_{_{\text{Ann}}} - \mu_{_{\text{SAT}}}}
      {\sigma_{_{\text{SAT}}}}
  = \frac{\annsatscore{} - \satmean{}}{\satsd{}}
  = \annsatzscore{}
\end{align*}

\begin{onebox}{The Z-score}
  The Z-score of an observation is the number of standard
  deviations it falls above or below the mean.
  We compute the Z-score for an observation $x$ that follows
  a distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation
  $\sigma$ using
  \begin{align*}
  Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
  \end{align*}
\end{onebox}

\begin{exercisewrap}
\begin{nexercise}
Use Tom's ACT score, \tomsatscore{}, along with the ACT mean and
standard deviation to compute his Z-score.\footnotemark{}
\end{nexercise}
\end{exercisewrap}
\footnotetext{$Z_{Tom}
  = \frac{x_{\text{Tom}} - \mu_{\text{ACT}}}
      {\sigma_{\text{ACT}}}
  = \frac{\tomsatscore{} - \actmean{}}{\actsd{}}
  = \tomsatzscore{}$}

Observations above the mean always have positive Z-scores,
while those below the mean always have negative Z-scores.
If an observation is equal to the mean,
such as an SAT score of \satmean{}, then the Z-score is $0$.

\begin{exercisewrap}
\begin{nexercise}

and suppose we observe $x=5.19$. \\

%\end{enumerate}
\end{nexercise}
\end{exercisewrap}
\footnotetext{(a) Its Z-score is given by
    $Z
      = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}
      = \frac{5.19 - 3}{2}
      = 2.19/2
      = 1.095$.
    (b)~The observation $x$ is 1.095 standard deviations
    \emph{above} the mean.
    We know it must be above the mean since $Z$ is positive.}

\begin{exercisewrap}
\begin{nexercise} \label{headLZScore}
Head lengths of brushtail possums follow a nearly normal
distribution with mean 92.6 mm and standard deviation 3.6 mm.
Compute the Z-scores for possums with head lengths of 95.4 mm
and 85.8 mm.\footnotemark{}
\end{nexercise}
\end{exercisewrap}
\footnotetext{For $x_1=95.4$ mm:
    $Z_1
      = \frac{x_1 - \mu}{\sigma}
      = \frac{95.4 - 92.6}{3.6}
      = 0.78$.
    For $x_2=85.8$ mm:
    $Z_2 = \frac{85.8 - 92.6}{3.6} = -1.89$.}

We can use Z-scores to roughly identify which observations
are more unusual than others.
An observation $x_1$ is said to be more unusual than another
observation $x_2$ if the absolute value of its Z-score is larger
than the absolute value of the other observation's Z-score:
$|Z_1| > |Z_2|$.
This technique is especially insightful when a distribution
is symmetric.

\begin{exercisewrap}
\begin{nexercise}
Which of the observations in Guided Practice~\ref{headLZScore}
is more unusual?\footnotemark{}
\end{nexercise}
\end{exercisewrap}
\footnotetext{Because the \emph{absolute value} of Z-score
  for the second observation is larger than that of the first,
  the second observation has a more unusual head length.}


\subsection{Normal probability table}

We can use the normal model to find percentiles.
\Add{Instructions for using statistical software are
  provided through the
  \oiRedirect{os2_lab_03A}{OpenIntro software labs};
  software is the standard tool for data scientists
  to work with the normal distribution.
  Graphing calculators may also be used, and we provide
  instructions for both Casio and TI calculators
  through the links at the start of this section.
  If you are using either of these methods when working
  with normal distributions,
  you should confirm you are getting the same results
  as the examples below.}

Finding percentiles may also be accomplished with a
\term{normal probability table},
which lists Z-scores and corresponding percentiles
and is what is covered in this subsection.

A probability table is provided in
Appendix~\vref{normalProbabilityTable}
and abbreviated in Figure~\ref{zTableShort}.
We use this table to identify the percentile corresponding
to any particular Z-score.
For instance, the percentile of $Z = 0.45$ is shown in row
$0.4$ and column $0.05$ in Figure~\ref{zTableShort}:
0.6736, or the $67.36^{th}$ percentile.
Generally, we round $Z$ to two decimals, identify the proper
row in the normal probability table up through the first decimal,
and then determine the column representing the second decimal
value.
The intersection of this row and column is the percentile
of the observation.

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{Ann from Example~\ref{actSAT} earned a score
    of \annsatscore{} on her SAT with a corresponding
    $Z = \annsatzscore{}$.
    She would like to know what percentile she falls in among
    all SAT test-takers.}
  Ann's \term{percentile} is the percentage of people who
  earned a lower SAT score than Ann.
  We shade the area representing those individuals in the
  following graph:
  \begin{center}
  \Figure{0.47}{satBelow1300}
  \end{center}
  The total area under the normal curve is always equal to~1,
  and the proportion of people who scored below Ann on the SAT
  is equal to the \emph{area} shaded in the graph: 0.8413.
  In other words, Ann is in the $84^{th}$ percentile of
  SAT takers.
\end{nexample}

We can also find the Z-score associated with a percentile.
For example, to identify Z for the $80^{th}$ percentile,
we look for the value closest to 0.8000 in the middle portion
of the table: 0.7995.
We determine the Z-score for the $80^{th}$ percentile by
combining the row and column Z values: 0.84.

  (Generally ties are ignored when the normal model,
  or any other continuous distribution, is used.)}


\subsection{Normal probability examples}
\label{normal_probability_examples}

Cumulative SAT scores are approximated well by a normal model,
$N(\mu = \satmean{}, \sigma = \satsd{})$.

\newcommand{\shannonsat}{1190}
\newcommand{\shannonsatz}{0.45}
\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{Shannon is a randomly selected SAT taker,
    and nothing is known about Shannon's SAT aptitude.
    What is the probability Shannon scores at least
    \shannonsat{} on her SATs?}
  \label{satAbove1190Exam}%
  First, always draw and label a picture of the normal
  distribution.
  (Drawings need not be exact to be useful.)
  We are interested in the chance she scores above
  \shannonsat{}, so we shade this upper tail:
  \begin{center}
  \Figure{0.4}{satAbove1190}
  \end{center}
  The picture shows the mean and the values at
  2~standard deviations above and below the mean.
  The simplest way to find the shaded area under
  the curve makes use of the Z-score of the cutoff value.
  With $\mu = \satmean{}$, $\sigma = \satsd{}$,
  and the cutoff value $x = \shannonsat{}$,
  the Z-score is computed as
  \begin{align*}
  Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
    = \frac{\shannonsat{} - \satmean{}}{\satsd{}}
    = \frac{90}{\satsd{}}
    = \shannonsatz{}
  \end{align*}
  We can use software or the normal probability table
  in Figure~\ref{zTableShort}
  (also in Appendix~\vref{normalProbabilityTable})
  to get 0.6736.
  However, the percentile describes those who had a Z-score
  \emph{lower} than \shannonsatz{}.
  To find the area \emph{above} $Z = \shannonsatz{}$,
  we compute one minus the area of the lower tail:
  \begin{center}
  \Figure{0.4}{subtractingArea}
  \end{center}
  The probability Shannon scores at least 1190 on the SAT
  is 0.3264.
\end{nexample}
\end{examplewrap}

\begin{onebox}{Always draw a picture first,
    and find the Z-score second}
  For any normal probability situation,
  \emph{always always always} draw and label the
  normal curve and shade the area of interest first.
  The picture will provide an estimate of the probability.
  After drawing a figure to represent the situation,
  identify the Z-score for the value of interest.
\end{onebox}

\begin{exercisewrap}
\begin{nexercise}
If the probability of Shannon scoring at least \shannonsat{}
is 0.3264, then what is the probability she scores less than
\shannonsat{}?
Draw the normal curve representing this exercise,
shading the lower region instead of the upper one.\footnotemark{}
\end{nexercise}
\end{exercisewrap}
\footnotetext{We found the probability in
  Example~\ref{satAbove1190Exam}: 0.6736.
  A picture for this exercise is represented by the shaded
  area below ``0.6736'' in Example~\ref{satAbove1190Exam}.}


\newcommand{\edwardsat}{1030}
\newcommand{\edwardsatz}{-0.35}
\newcommand{\edwardsatlower}{0.3632}
\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{Edward earned a \edwardsat{} on his SAT.
    What is his percentile?}
  \label{edwardSatBelow\edwardsat{}}%
  First, a picture is needed.
  Edward's percentile is the proportion of people who do not
  get as high as a \edwardsat{}.
  These are the scores to the left of \edwardsat{}.
\begin{center}
\Figure{0.3}{satBelow1030}
\end{center}
Identifying the mean $\mu=\satmean{}$, the standard
deviation $\sigma=\satsd{}$, and the cutoff for the tail
area $x=\edwardsat{}$ makes it easy to compute the Z-score:
\begin{align*}
Z
  = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
  = \frac{\edwardsat{} - \satmean{}}{\satsd{}}
  = \edwardsatz{}
\end{align*}
If using the normal probability table,
identify the row of $-0.3$ and column of $0.05$,
which corresponds to the probability $0.3632$.
Software will give you the same result.
Edward is at the $36^{th}$ percentile.
\end{nexample}
\end{examplewrap}

\begin{exercisewrap}
\begin{nexercise}
Use the results of Example~\ref{edwardSatBelow\edwardsat{}}
to compute the proportion of SAT takers who did better than
Edward.

\footnotetext{If Edward did better than 36\% of SAT takers,
  then about 64\% must have done better than him. \\

  \Figure{0.45}{mikeAndJimPercentiles}}

The last several problems have focused on finding the
percentile (or upper tail) for a particular observation.
What if you would like to know the observation corresponding
to a particular percentile?

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{Erik's height is at the $40^{th}$ percentile.
    How tall is he?}\label{normalExam40Perc}
  As always, first draw the picture.\vspace{-4mm}
  \begin{center}
  \Figure{0.3}{height40Perc}\vspace{-1mm}
  \end{center}
  In this case, the lower tail probability is known (0.40),
  which can be shaded on the diagram.
  We want to find the observation that corresponds to this value.
  As a first step in this direction, we determine the Z-score
  associated with the $40^{th}$ percentile.

  If we are using software, you should find the option to
  take a percentile and obtain a Z-score.
  If you are using software, confirm you get the same result!

  If using the normal probability table, then because the
  percentile is below 50\%, we know $Z$ will be negative.
  We search for the probability \emph{inside} the table
  closest to 0.4000.
  We find that 0.4000 falls in row $-0.2$ and between columns
  $0.05$ and $0.06$.
  Since it falls closer to $0.05$, we take this one: $Z=-0.25$.

  Knowing $Z_{Erik}=-0.25$ and the population parameters
  $\mu=70$ and $\sigma=3.3$ inches, the Z-score formula can be
  set up to determine Erik's unknown height, labeled $x_{Erik}$:
  \begin{align*}
  -0.25
    = Z_{_{\text{Erik}}}
    = \frac{x_{_{\text{Erik}}} - \mu}{\sigma}
    = \frac{x_{_{\text{Erik}}} - 70}{3.3}
  \end{align*}
  Solving for $x_{_{\text{Erik}}}$ yields a height of 69.18 inches.
  That is, Erik is about 5'9''.

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{What is the adult male height at the

  Again, we draw the figure first.\vspace{-3mm}
  \begin{center}
  \Figure{0.28}{height82Perc}\vspace{-1mm}
  \end{center}
  Next, we want to find the Z-score at the $82^{nd}$ percentile,
  which will be a positive value.
  If using the Z-table, not software,
  we find that $Z$ falls in row $0.9$
  and the nearest column is $0.02$, i.e. $Z = 0.92$.
  (If you are using software, confirm you get this same result.)
  Finally, the height $x$ is found using the Z-score formula
  with the known mean $\mu$, standard deviation $\sigma$,
  and Z-score $Z = 0.92$:
  \begin{align*}
  0.92 = Z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} = \frac{x - 70}{3.3}
  \end{align*}
  This yields 73.04 inches or about 6'1'' as the height
  at the $82^{nd}$ percentile.

\subsection{68-95-99.7 rule}

Here, we present a useful rule of thumb for the probability of falling within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations of the mean in the normal distribution. This will be useful in a wide range of practical settings, especially when trying to make a quick estimate without a calculator or Z-table.

\begin{figure}[hht]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=1.9in]{ch_distributions/figures/6895997/6895997}
\caption{Probabilities for falling within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations of the mean in a normal distribution.}
\label{6895997}
\end{figure}

\begin{exercisewrap}
\begin{nexercise}
Use the Z-table to confirm that about 68\%, 95\%, and 99.7\%
of observations fall within 1, 2, and 3, standard deviations
of the mean in the normal distribution, respectively.
For instance, first find the area that falls between $Z=-1$
and $Z=1$, which should have an area of about 0.68.
Similarly there should be an area of about 0.95 between
$Z=-2$ and $Z=2$.\footnotemark{}
\end{nexercise}
\end{exercisewrap}
\footnotetext{First draw the pictures.
  To find the area between $Z=-1$ and $Z=1$,
  we can use the normal probability table to determine
  the areas below $Z=-1$ and above $Z=1$.
  (Or use software!)
  Next verify the area between $Z=-1$ and $Z=1$ is about 0.68.
  Repeat this for $Z=-2$ to $Z=2$ and also for $Z=-3$ to $Z=3$.}

It is possible for a normal random variable to fall 4,~5,
or~even more standard deviations from the mean.
However, these occurrences are very rare if the data are
nearly normal.
The probability of being further than 4 standard deviations
from the mean is about 1-in-15,000.
For 5 and 6 standard deviations, it is about 1-in-2 million
and 1-in-500 million, respectively.

\begin{exercisewrap}
\begin{nexercise}

(b) What percent score between \satmean{} and 1500?\footnotemark{}
\end{nexercise}
\end{exercisewrap}
\footnotetext{(a) 700 and 1500 represent two standard deviations
  above and below the mean, which means about 95\% of test takers
  will score between 700 and 1500.
  (b)~We found that 700 to 1500 represents about 95\% of test
  takers.
  These test takers would be evenly split by the center of
  the distribution, \satmean{},
  so $\frac{95\%}{2} = 47.5\%$ of all test takers
  score between \satmean{} and 1500.}

\section{Evaluating the normal approximation}
\label{assessingNormal}

Many processes can be well approximated by the normal distribution.
We have already seen two good examples:
SAT scores and the heights of US adult males.
While using a normal model can be extremely convenient
and helpful, it is important to remember normality is
always an approximation.
Evaluating the appropriateness of the normal assumption
is a key step in many data analyses.

\index{normal probability plot|(}

Example~\ref{normalExam40Perc} in Section~\ref{normalDist}
suggested the distribution of heights of US males is well
approximated by the normal model.
We are interested in proceeding under the assumption that
the data are normally distributed, but first we must check
to see if this is reasonable.

There are two visual methods for checking the assumption of
normality, which can be implemented and interpreted quickly.
The first is a simple histogram with the best fitting normal
curve overlaid on the plot, as shown in the left panel of
Figure~\ref{fcidMHeights}.
The sample mean $\bar{x}$ and standard deviation $s$ are used
as the parameters of the best fitting normal curve.
The closer this curve fits the histogram, the more reasonable
the normal model assumption.
Another common method is examining a
\term{normal probability plot},\footnote{Also commonly
  called a \term{quantile-quantile plot}.}
shown in the right panel of Figure~\ref{fcidMHeights}.
The closer the points are to a perfect straight line,
the more confident we can be that the data follow the
normal model.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \Figure{0.7}{fcidMHeights}
  \caption{A sample of 100 male heights.
      The observations are rounded to the nearest whole inch,
      explaining why the points appear to jump in increments
      in the normal probability plot.}
  \label{fcidMHeights}
\end{figure}

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{Three data sets of 40, 100, and 400
    samples were simulated from a normal distribution,
    and the histograms and normal probability plots
    of the data sets are shown in Figure~\ref{normalExamples}.
    These will provide a benchmark for what to look for
    in plots of real data.}
  \label{normalExamplesExample}%
  The left panels show the histogram (top) and normal
  probability plot (bottom) for the simulated data set
  with 40 observations.
  The data set is too small to really see clear structure
  in the histogram.
  The normal probability plot also reflects this,
  where there are some deviations from the line.
  We should expect deviations of this amount for
  such a small data set.

  The middle panels show diagnostic plots for the
  data set with 100 simulated observations.
  The histogram shows more normality and the normal
  probability plot shows a better fit.
  While there are a few observations that deviate
  noticeably from the line, they are not particularly
  extreme.

  The data set with 400 observations has a histogram
  that greatly resembles the normal distribution,
  while the normal probability plot is nearly a perfect
  straight line.
  Again in the normal probability plot there is one
  observation (the largest) that deviates slightly from
  the line.
  If that observation had deviated 3 times further from
  the line, it would be of greater importance in a real
  data set.
  Apparent outliers can occur in normally distributed
  data but they are rare.

  Notice the histograms look more normal as the sample
  size increases, and the normal probability plot becomes
  straighter and more stable.

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{Are NBA player heights normally distributed?
    Consider all 494 NBA players presented in
    Figure~\ref{nbaNormal}.}
  We first create a histogram and normal probability plot
  of the NBA player heights.
  The histogram in the left panel appears to have too few
  observations at the upper end since the curve is notably
  above the histogram.
  The points in the normal probability plot
  follow a straight line for much of the center of the
  distribution, and then deviates more at the upper values.
  We can compare these characteristics to the sample of
  400 normally distributed observations in
  Example~\ref{normalExamplesExample} and see that they
  represent much stronger deviations from the normal model.
  NBA player heights do not appear to come from a normal
  distribution.

\section{Geometric distribution}
\label{geomDist}

How long should we expect to flip a coin until it turns up \resp{heads}? Or how many times should we expect to roll a die until we get a \resp{1}? These questions can be answered using the geometric distribution. We first formalize each trial -- such as a single coin flip or die toss -- using the Bernoulli distribution, and then we combine these with our tools from probability (Chapter~\ref{probability}) to construct the geometric distribution.

\subsection{Bernoulli distribution}
\label{bernoulli}

\index{distribution!Bernoulli|(}

Stanley Milgram\index{Milgram, Stanley} began a series of experiments in 1963 to estimate what proportion of people would willingly obey an authority and give severe shocks to a stranger. Milgram found that about 65\% of people would obey the authority and give such shocks. Over the years, additional research suggested this number is approximately consistent across communities and time.\footnote{Find further information on Milgram's experiment at \par \ \ \hspace{0.2mm}\ \oiRedirect{textbook-milgram}{www.cnr.berkeley.edu/ucce50/ag-labor/7article/article35.htm}.}

Each person in Milgram's experiment can be thought of as a \term{trial}. We label a person a \term{success} if she refuses to administer the worst shock. A person is labeled a \term{failure} if she administers the worst shock. Because only 35\% of individuals refused to administer the most severe shock, we denote the \term{probability of a success} with $p=0.35$. The probability of a failure is sometimes denoted with $q=1-p$.

Thus, \resp{success} or \resp{failure} is recorded for
each person in the study.
When an individual trial only has two possible outcomes,
it is called a
\termsub{Bernoulli random variable}{distribution!Bernoulli}.
We chose to label a person who refuses to administer the
worst shock a ``success'' and all others as ``failures''.
However, we could just as easily have reversed these labels.
The mathematical framework we will build does not depend
on which outcome is labeled a success and which a failure,
as long as we are consistent.

Bernoulli random variables are often denoted as \resp{1}
for a success and \resp{0} for a failure.
In addition to being convenient in entering data,
it is also mathematically handy.
Suppose we observe ten trials:
\begin{center}
\resp{0} \resp{1} \resp{1} \resp{1} \resp{1} \resp{0} \resp{1} \resp{1} \resp{0} \resp{0}
\end{center}
Then the \term{sample proportion}, $\hat{p}$, is the
sample mean of these observations:
\begin{align*}
\hat{p} = \frac{\text{\# of successes}}{\text{\# of trials}}
    = \frac{0+1+1+1+1+0+1+1+0+0}{10} = 0.6
\end{align*}%
This mathematical inquiry of Bernoulli random variables can
be extended even further.
\Comment{Maybe the next footnote should instead be an EOCE?}
Because \resp{0} and \resp{1} are numerical outcomes,
we can define the {mean} and {standard deviation}
of a Bernoulli random variable.\footnote{If ${p}$ is the true probability of a success, then the mean of a Bernoulli random variable $X$ is given by
\begin{align*}
\mu = E[X] &= P(X = 0) \times 0 + P(X = 1) \times 1 \\
	&= (1 - p) \times 0 + p\times 1 = 0 + p = p
\end{align*}
Similarly, the variance of $X$ can be computed:
\begin{align*}
\sigma^2 &= {P(X=0)(0-p)^2 + P(X=1)(1-p)^2} \\
	&= {(1-p)p^2 + p(1-p)^2} = {p(1-p)}
\end{align*}
The standard deviation is $\sigma=\sqrt{p(1-p)}$.}

\begin{onebox}{Bernoulli random variable}
%  A Bernoulli random variable has exactly two possible
%  outcomes, often labeled \resp{1} for the ``success''
%  outcome and \resp{0} for the ``failure'' outcome.\vspace{3mm}
  If $X$ is a random variable that takes value 1 with
  probability of success $p$ and 0 with probability $1-p$,
  then $X$ is a Bernoulli random variable with mean
  and standard deviation
  \begin{align*}
  \mu &= p
      &\sigma&= \sqrt{p(1-p)}
  \end{align*}
\end{onebox}

In general, it is useful to think about a Bernoulli random variable as a random process with only two outcomes: a success or failure. Then we build our mathematical framework using the numerical labels \resp{1} and \resp{0} for successes and failures, respectively.

\index{distribution!Bernoulli|)}

\subsection{Geometric distribution}

\index{distribution!geometric|(}

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{Dr. Smith wants to repeat Milgram's experiments but she only wants to sample people until she finds someone who will not inflict the worst shock.\footnotemark If the probability a person will \emph{not} give the most severe shock is still 0.35 and the subjects are independent, what are the chances that she will stop the study after the first person? The second person? The third? What about if it takes her $n-1$ individuals who will administer the worst shock before finding her first success, i.e. the first success is on the $n^{th}$ person? (If the first success is the fifth person, then we say $n=5$.)} \label{waitForShocker}
The probability of stopping after the first person is just the chance the first person will not administer the worst shock: $1-0.65=0.35$. The probability it will be the second person is
\begin{align*}
&P(\text{second person is the first to not administer the
    worst shock}) \\
&\quad = P(\text{the first will, the second won't})
    = (0.65)(0.35)
    = 0.228
\end{align*}
Likewise, the probability it will be the third person is $(0.65)(0.65)(0.35) = 0.148$.

If the first success is on the $n^{th}$ person, then there are $n-1$ failures and finally 1 success, which corresponds to the probability $(0.65)^{n-1}(0.35)$. This is the same as $(1-0.35)^{n-1}(0.35)$.
\end{nexample}
\end{examplewrap}
\footnotetext{This is hypothetical since, in reality, this sort of study probably would not be permitted any longer under current ethical standards.}

Example~\ref{waitForShocker} illustrates what is called the geometric distribution, which describes the waiting time until a success for \term{independent and identically distributed (iid)} Bernoulli random variables. In this case, the \emph{independence} aspect just means the individuals in the example don't affect each other, and \emph{identical} means they each have the same probability of success.

The geometric distribution from Example~\ref{waitForShocker} is shown in Figure~\ref{geometricDist35}. In general, the probabilities for a geometric distribution decrease \term{exponentially} fast.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{ch_distributions/figures/geometricDist35/geometricDist35}
\caption{The geometric distribution when the probability of success is $p=0.35$.}
\label{geometricDist35}
\end{figure}

While this text will not derive the formulas for the mean (expected) number of trials needed to find the first success or the standard deviation or variance of this distribution, we present general formulas for each.

\begin{onebox}{Geometric Distribution}
  \index{distribution!geometric|textbf}%
  If the probability of a success in one trial is $p$
  and the probability of a failure is $1-p$, then the
  probability of finding the first success in the
  $n^{th}$ trial is given by\vspace{-1.5mm}
  \begin{align*}
  (1-p)^{n-1}p
  \end{align*}
  The mean (i.e. expected value), variance,
  and standard deviation of this wait time are given by
  \begin{align*}
  \mu &= \frac{1}{p}
      &\sigma^2 &=\frac{1-p}{p^2}
      &\sigma &= \sqrt{\frac{1-p}{p^2}}
  \end{align*}
\end{onebox}

It is no accident that we use the symbol $\mu$ for both the mean and expected value. The mean and the expected value are one and the same.

It takes, on average, $1/p$ trials to get a success under the geometric distribution. This mathematical result is consistent with what we would expect intuitively. If the probability of a success is high (e.g. 0.8), then we don't usually wait very long for a success: $1/0.8 = 1.25$ trials on average. If the probability of a success is low (e.g. 0.1), then we would expect to view many trials before we see a success: $1/0.1 = 10$ trials.

\begin{exercisewrap}
\begin{nexercise}
The probability that an individual would refuse to administer the worst shock is said to be about 0.35. If we were to examine individuals until we found one that did not administer the shock, how many people should we expect to check?\footnotemark{}
\end{nexercise}
\end{exercisewrap}
\footnotetext{We would expect to see about $1/0.35 = 2.86$ individuals to find the first success.}

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{What is the chance that Dr. Smith will find the first success within the first 4 people?} \label{marglimFirstSuccessIn4}
This is the chance it is the first ($n=1$), second ($n=2$), third ($n=3$), or fourth ($n=4$) person as the first success, which are four disjoint outcomes. Because the individuals in the sample are randomly sampled from a large population, they are independent. We compute the probability of each case and add the separate results:
\begin{align*}
&P(n=1, 2, 3,\text{ or }4) \\
  & \quad = P(n=1)+P(n=2)+P(n=3)+P(n=4) \\
  & \quad = (0.65)^{1-1}(0.35) + (0.65)^{2-1}(0.35) + (0.65)^{3-1}(0.35) + (0.65)^{4-1}(0.35) \\
  & \quad = 0.82
\end{align*}
There is an 82\% chance that she will end the study within 4~people.

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{Suppose in one region it was found that the proportion of people who would administer the worst shock was ``only'' 55\%.

A success is when someone will \textbf{not} inflict the worst shock, which has probability $p=1-0.55=0.45$ for this region. The expected number of people to be checked is $1/p = 1/0.45 = 2.22$ and the standard deviation is $\sqrt{(1-p)/p^2} = 1.65$.

\footnotetext{No. The geometric distribution is always right skewed and can never be well-approximated by the normal model.}

The independence assumption is crucial to the geometric distribution's accurate description of a scenario. Mathematically, we can see that to construct the probability of the success on the $n^{th}$ trial, we had to use the Multiplication Rule for Independent Processes. It is no simple task to generalize the geometric model for dependent trials.

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{Suppose we randomly selected four individuals to participate in the ``shock" study. What is the chance exactly one of them will be a success?  Let's call the four people Allen ($A$), Brittany ($B$), Caroline ($C$), and Damian ($D$) for convenience. Also, suppose 35\% of people are successes as in the previous version of this example.}\label{oneRefuser}
Let's consider a scenario where one person refuses:
\begin{align*}
&P(A=\text{\resp{refuse}},\text{ }B=\text{\resp{shock}},
    \text{ }C=\text{\resp{shock}},\text{ }D=\text{\resp{shock}}) \\
  &\quad = P(A=\text{\resp{refuse}})\ 
      P(B=\text{\resp{shock}})\ 
      P(C=\text{\resp{shock}})\ P(D=\text{\resp{shock}}) \\
  &\quad =  (0.35)  (0.65)  (0.65)  (0.65)
      = (0.35)^1 (0.65)^3
      = 0.096
\end{align*}
But there are three other scenarios: Brittany, Caroline, or Damian could have been the one to refuse. In each of these cases, the probability is again $(0.35)^1(0.65)^3$. These four scenarios exhaust all the possible ways that exactly one of these four people could refuse to administer the most severe shock, so the total probability is $4\times(0.35)^1(0.65)^3 = 0.38$.
\end{nexample}
\end{examplewrap}

\begin{exercisewrap}
\begin{nexercise}
Verify that the scenario where Brittany is the only one to refuse to give the most severe shock has probability $(0.35)^1(0.65)^3$.~\footnotemark

\end{exercisewrap}
\footnotetext{$P(A=\text{\resp{shock}},\text{ }B=\text{\resp{refuse}},\text{ }C=\text{\resp{shock}},\text{ }D=\text{\resp{shock}}) = (0.65)(0.35)(0.65)(0.65) = (0.35)^1(0.65)^3$.}


\subsection{The binomial distribution}

The scenario outlined in Example~\ref{oneRefuser} is a special case of what is called the binomial distribution. The \termsub{binomial distribution}{distribution!binomial} describes the probability of having exactly $k$ successes in $n$ independent Bernoulli trials with probability of a success $p$  (in Example~\ref{oneRefuser}, $n=4$, $k=1$, $p=0.35$). We would like to determine the probabilities associated with the binomial distribution more generally, i.e. we want a formula where we can use $n$, $k$, and $p$ to obtain the probability. To do this, we reexamine each part of the example.

There were four individuals who could have been the one to refuse, and each of these four scenarios had the same probability. Thus, we could identify the final probability as
\begin{align*}
[\text{\# of scenarios}] \times P(\text{single scenario})
\end{align*}
The first component of this equation is the number of ways to arrange the $k=1$ successes among the $n=4$ trials. The second component is the probability of any of the four (equally probable) scenarios.

Consider $P($single scenario$)$ under the general case of $k$ successes and $n-k$ failures in the $n$ trials. In any such scenario, we apply the Multiplication Rule for independent events:
\begin{align*}
p^k(1-p)^{n-k}
\end{align*}
This is our general formula for $P($single scenario$)$.

Secondly, we introduce a general formula for the number of ways to choose $k$ successes in $n$ trials, i.e. arrange $k$ successes and $n-k$ failures:
\begin{align*}
{n\choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\end{align*}
The quantity ${n\choose k}$ is read \term{n choose k}.\footnote{Other notation for $n$ choose $k$ includes $_nC_k$, $C_n^k$, and $C(n,k)$.} The exclamation point notation (e.g. $k!$) denotes a \term{factorial} expression.
\begin{align*}
& 0! = 1 \\
& 1! = 1 \\
& 2! = 2\times1 = 2 \\
& 3! = 3\times2\times1 = 6 \\
& 4! = 4\times3\times2\times1 = 24 \\
& \vdots \\
& n! = n\times(n-1)\times...\times3\times2\times1
\end{align*}
Using the formula, we can compute the number of ways to choose $k=1$ successes in $n=4$ trials:
\begin{align*}
{4 \choose 1} = \frac{4!}{1!(4-1)!}
  = \frac{4!}{1!3!} 
  = \frac{4\times3\times2\times1}{(1)(3\times2\times1)}
  = 4
\end{align*}
This result is exactly what we found by carefully thinking of each possible scenario in Example~\ref{oneRefuser}.

Substituting $n$ choose $k$ for the number of scenarios and $p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$ for the single scenario probability yields the general binomial formula.

\begin{onebox}{Binomial distribution}
  Suppose the probability of a single trial being a success is $p$. Then the probability of observing exactly $k$ successes in $n$ independent trials is given by\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{align*}
{n\choose k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}
\end{align*}
Additionally, the mean, variance, and standard deviation of the number of observed successes are\vspace{-2mm}
\begin{align*}
\mu &= np
\sigma^2 &= np(1-p)
\sigma &= \sqrt{np(1-p)}
\end{align*}
\end{onebox}

\begin{onebox}{Is it binomial? Four conditions to check.}
\label{isItBinomialTipBox}%
(1) The trials are independent. \\
(2) The number of trials, $n$, is fixed. \\
(3) Each trial outcome can be classified as a \emph{success} or \emph{failure}. \\
(4) The probability of a success, $p$, is the same for each trial.
\end{onebox}

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{What is the probability that 3 of 8 randomly selected students will refuse to administer the worst shock, i.e. 5 of 8 will?}
We would like to apply the binomial model, so we check our conditions. The number of trials is fixed ($n=8$) (condition 2) and each trial outcome can be classified as a success or failure (condition 3). Because the sample is random, the trials are independent (condition~1) and the probability of a success is the same for each trial (condition~4).

In the outcome of interest, there are $k=3$ successes in $n=8$ trials, and the probability of a success is $p=0.35$. So the probability that 3 of 8 will refuse is given by
\begin{align*}
{ 8 \choose 3}(0.35)^3(1-0.35)^{8-3}
	&= \frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!}(0.35)^3(1-0.35)^{8-3} \\
	&= \frac{8!}{3!5!}(0.35)^3(0.65)^5
\end{align*}
Dealing with the factorial part:
\begin{align*}
\frac{8!}{3!5!} = \frac{8\times7\times6\times5\times4\times3\times2\times1}{(3\times2\times1)(5\times4\times3\times2\times1)} = \frac{8\times7\times6}{3\times2\times1} = 56
\end{align*}
Using $(0.35)^3(0.65)^5 \approx 0.005$, the final probability is about $56*0.005 = 0.28$.
\end{nexample}
\end{examplewrap}

\begin{onebox}{Computing binomial probabilities}
  The first step in using the binomial model is to check
  that the model is appropriate.
  The second step is to identify $n$, $p$, and $k$.
  The final step is to apply the formulas and interpret
  the results.\vspace{3mm}

  If you must do calculations by hand, it's often useful
  to cancel out as many terms as possible in the top and
  bottom of the binomial coefficient.

\end{nexercise}
\end{exercisewrap}
\footnotetext{We are asked to determine the expected number (the mean) and the standard deviation, both of which can be directly computed from the formulas: $\mu=np = 40\times 0.35 = 14$ and $\sigma = \sqrt{np(1-p)} = \sqrt{40\times 0.35\times 0.65} = 3.02$. Because very roughly 95\% of observations fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean (see Section~\ref{variability}), we would probably observe at least 8 but less than 20 individuals in our sample who would refuse to administer the shock.}

(c) That no more than one will develop a severe lung condition?\footnotemark

\footnotetext{To check if the binomial model is appropriate, we must verify the conditions. (i) Since we are supposing we can treat the friends as a random sample, they are independent. (ii) We have a fixed number of trials ($n=4$). (iii) Each outcome is a success or failure. (iv) The probability of a success is the same for each trials since the individuals are like a random sample ($p=0.3$ if we say a ``success'' is someone getting a lung condition, a morbid choice). Compute parts (a) and (b) using the binomial formula: $P(0) =  {4 \choose 0} (0.3)^0 (0.7)^4 = 1\times1\times0.7^4 = 0.2401$, $P(1) = {4 \choose 1} (0.3)^1(0.7)^{3} = 0.4116$. Note: $0!=1$, as shown on
page~\pageref{factorialDefinitionInTheBinomialSection}.
Part (c) can be computed as the sum of parts (a) and (b): $P(0) + P(1) = 0.2401 + 0.4116 = 0.6517$. That is, there is about a 65\% chance that no more than one of your four smoking friends will develop a severe lung condition.}

\subsection{Normal approximation to the binomial distribution}
\label{normalApproxBinomialDistSubsection}

\index{distribution!binomial!normal approximation|(}

The binomial formula is cumbersome when the sample size ($n$) is large, particularly when we consider a range of observations. In some cases we may use the normal distribution as an easier and faster way to estimate binomial probabilities.

\Comment{\href{https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/adult_data/cig_smoking/index.htm}{This page} suggests the actual smoking rate is now closer to 15.5\%.}

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{Approximately 20\% of the US population smokes cigarettes. A local government believed their community had a lower smoker rate and commissioned a survey of 400 randomly selected individuals. The survey found that only 59 of the 400 participants smoke cigarettes. If the true proportion of smokers in the community was really 20\%, what is the probability of observing 59 or fewer smokers in a sample of 400 people?}\label{exactBinomialForN400P20SmokerExample}
We leave the usual verification that the four conditions for the binomial model are valid as an exercise.

The question posed is equivalent to asking, what is the probability of observing $k=0$, 1, ..., 58, or 59 smokers in a sample of $n=400$ when $p=0.20$? We can compute these 60 different probabilities and add them together to find the answer:
\begin{align*}
&P(k=0\text{ or }k=1\text{ or }\cdots\text{ or } k=59) \\
	&\qquad= P(k=0) + P(k=1) + \cdots + P(k=59) \\
	&\qquad=0.0041
\end{align*}
If the true proportion of smokers in the community is $p=0.20$, then the probability of observing 59 or fewer smokers in a sample of $n=400$ is less than 0.0041.
\end{nexample}
\end{examplewrap}

The computations in Example~\ref{exactBinomialForN400P20SmokerExample} are tedious and long. In general, we should avoid such work if an alternative method exists that is faster, easier, and still accurate. Recall that calculating probabilities of a range of values is much easier in the normal model. We might wonder, is it reasonable to use the normal model in place of the binomial distribution? Surprisingly, yes, if certain conditions are met.

\begin{exercisewrap}
\begin{nexercise}
Here we consider the binomial model when the probability of a success is $p=0.10$. Figure~\ref{fourBinomialModelsShowingApproxToNormal} shows four hollow histograms for simulated samples from the binomial distribution using four different sample sizes: $n=10, 30, 100, 300$. What happens to the shape of the distributions as the sample size increases? What distribution does the last hollow histogram resemble?\footnotemark
\end{nexercise}
\end{exercisewrap}
\footnotetext{The distribution is transformed from a blocky and skewed distribution into one that rather resembles the normal distribution in last hollow histogram}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.92\textwidth]{ch_distributions/figures/fourBinomialModelsShowingApproxToNormal/fourBinomialModelsShowingApproxToNormal}
\caption{Hollow histograms of samples from the binomial model when $p=0.10$. The sample sizes for the four plots are $n=10$, 30, 100, and 300, respectively.}
\label{fourBinomialModelsShowingApproxToNormal}
\end{figure}

\begin{onebox}{Normal approximation of the binomial distribution}
  The binomial distribution with probability of success
  $p$ is nearly normal when the sample size $n$ is
  sufficiently large that $np$ and $n(1-p)$ are both
  at least 10.
  The approximate normal distribution has parameters
  corresponding to the mean and standard deviation of
  the binomial distribution:\vspace{-1.5mm}
  \begin{align*}
  \mu &= np
      &\sigma& = \sqrt{np(1-p)}
  \end{align*}
\end{onebox}

The normal approximation may be used when computing the range of many possible successes. For instance, we may apply the normal distribution to the setting of Example~\ref{exactBinomialForN400P20SmokerExample}.

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{How can we use the normal approximation to estimate the probability of observing 59 or fewer smokers in a sample of 400, if the true proportion of smokers is $p=0.20$?} \label{approxBinomialForN400P20SmokerExample}
Showing that the binomial model is reasonable was a suggested exercise in Example~\ref{exactBinomialForN400P20SmokerExample}. We also verify that both $np$ and $n(1-p)$ are at least 10:
\begin{align*}
np&=400\times 0.20=80
&n(1-p)&=400\times 0.8=320
\end{align*}
With these conditions checked, we may use the normal approximation in place of the binomial distribution using the mean and standard deviation from the binomial model:
\begin{align*}
\mu &= np = 80
&\sigma &= \sqrt{np(1-p)} = 8
\end{align*}
We want to find the probability of observing fewer than 59 smokers using this model.
\end{nexample}
\end{examplewrap}

\begin{exercisewrap}
\begin{nexercise}
Use the normal model $N(\mu=80, \sigma=8)$ to estimate the probability of observing fewer than 59 smokers. Your answer should be approximately equal to the solution of Example~\ref{exactBinomialForN400P20SmokerExample}: 0.0041.\footnotemark
\end{nexercise}
\end{exercisewrap}
\footnotetext{Compute the Z-score first: $Z=\frac{59 - 80}{8} = -2.63$. The corresponding left tail area is 0.0043.}


\subsection{The normal approximation breaks down on small intervals}

The normal approximation to the binomial distribution tends to perform poorly when estimating the probability of a small range of counts, even when the conditions are met.

Suppose we wanted to compute the probability of observing 69, 70, or 71 smokers in 400 when $p=0.20$. With such a large sample, we might be tempted to apply the normal approximation and use the range 69 to 71. However, we would find that the binomial solution and the normal approximation notably differ:
\begin{align*}
\text{Binomial:}&\ 0.0703
&\text{Normal:}&\ 0.0476
\end{align*}
We can identify the cause of this discrepancy using Figure~\ref{normApproxToBinomFail}, which shows the areas representing the binomial probability (outlined) and normal approximation (shaded). Notice that the width of the area under the normal distribution is 0.5 units too slim on both sides of the interval.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ch_distributions/figures/normApproxToBinomFail/normApproxToBinomFail}
\caption{A normal curve with the area between 69 and 71 shaded. The outlined area represents the exact binomial probability.}
\label{normApproxToBinomFail}
\end{figure}

\begin{onebox}{Improving the normal approximation for the binomial distribution}
  The normal approximation to the binomial distribution
  for intervals of values is usually improved if cutoff
  values are modified slightly.
  The cutoff values for the lower end of a shaded region
  should be reduced by 0.5, and the cutoff value for the
  upper end should be increased by 0.5.
\end{onebox}

The tip to add extra area when applying the normal approximation is most often useful when examining a range of observations. While it is possible to apply it when computing a tail area, the benefit of the modification usually disappears since the total interval is typically quite wide.

\section{Negative binomial distribution}
\label{negativeBinomial}

\index{distribution!negative binomial|(}

The geometric distribution describes the probability of observing the first success on the $n^{th}$ trial. The \termsub{negative binomial distribution}{distribution!negative binomial} is more general: it describes the probability of observing the $k^{th}$ success on the $n^{th}$ trial.

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{Each day a high school football coach tells his star kicker, Brian, that he can go home after he successfully kicks four 35 yard field goals. Suppose we say each kick has a probability $p$ of being successful. If $p$ is small -- e.g. close to 0.1 -- would we expect Brian to need many attempts before he successfully kicks his fourth field goal?}
We are waiting for the fourth success ($k=4$). If the probability of a success ($p$) is small, then the number of attempts ($n$) will probably be large. This means that Brian is more likely to need many attempts before he gets $k=4$ successes. To put this another way, the probability of $n$ being small is low.
\end{nexample}
\end{examplewrap}

To identify a negative binomial case, we check 4 conditions. The first three are common to the binomial distribution.

\begin{onebox}{Is it negative binomial? Four conditions to check}
(1) The trials are independent. \\
(2) Each trial outcome can be classified as a success or failure. \\
(3) The probability of a success ($p$) is the same for each trial. \\
(4) The last trial must be a success.
\end{onebox}

\begin{exercisewrap}
\begin{nexercise}
Suppose Brian is very diligent in his attempts and he makes each 35 yard field goal with probability $p=0.8$. Take a guess at how many attempts he would need before making his fourth kick.\footnotemark
\end{nexercise}
\end{exercisewrap}
\footnotetext{One possible answer: since he is likely to make each field goal attempt, it will take him at least 4 attempts but probably not more than 6 or 7.}

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{In yesterday's practice, it took Brian only 6 tries to get his fourth field goal. Write out each of the possible sequence of kicks.} \label{eachSeqOfSixTriesToGetFourSuccesses}
Because it took Brian six tries to get the fourth success, we know the last kick must have been a success. That leaves three successful kicks and two unsuccessful kicks (we label these as failures) that make up the first five attempts. There are ten possible sequences of these first five kicks, which are shown in Figure~\ref{successFailureOrdersForBriansFieldGoals}. If Brian achieved his fourth success ($k=4$) on his sixth attempt ($n=6$), then his order of successes and failures must be one of these ten possible sequences.
\end{nexample}

\begin{exercisewrap}
\begin{nexercise} \label{probOfEachSeqOfSixTriesToGetFourSuccesses}
Each sequence in Figure~\ref{successFailureOrdersForBriansFieldGoals} has exactly two failures and four successes with the last attempt always being a success. If the probability of a success is $p=0.8$, find the probability of the first sequence.\footnotemark
\end{nexercise}
\end{exercisewrap}
\footnotetext{The first sequence:
    $0.2 \times 0.2 \times 0.8 \times 0.8 \times 0.8 \times 0.8
        = 0.0164$.}

If the probability Brian kicks a 35 yard field goal is $p=0.8$, what is the probability it takes Brian exactly six tries to get his fourth successful kick? We can write this as
{\small\begin{align*}
&P(\text{it takes Brian six tries to make four field goals}) \\
& \quad = P(\text{Brian makes three of his first five field goals, and he makes the sixth one}) \\
& \quad = P(\text{$1^{st}$ sequence OR $2^{nd}$ sequence OR ... OR $10^{th}$ sequence})
\end{align*}
}where the sequences are from Figure~\ref{successFailureOrdersForBriansFieldGoals}. We can break down this last probability into the sum of ten disjoint possibilities:
{\small\begin{align*}
&P(\text{$1^{st}$ sequence OR $2^{nd}$ sequence OR ... OR $10^{th}$ sequence}) \\
&\quad = P(\text{$1^{st}$ sequence}) + P(\text{$2^{nd}$ sequence}) + \cdots + P(\text{$10^{th}$ sequence})
\end{align*}
}The probability of the first sequence was identified in Guided Practice~\ref{probOfEachSeqOfSixTriesToGetFourSuccesses} as 0.0164, and each of the other sequences have the same probability. Since each of the ten sequence has the same probability, the total probability is ten times that of any individual sequence.

The way to compute this negative binomial probability is similar to how the binomial problems were solved in Section~\ref{binomialModel}. The probability is broken into two pieces:
\begin{align*}
&P(\text{it takes Brian six tries to make four field goals}) \\
&= [\text{Number of possible sequences}] \times P(\text{Single sequence})
\end{align*}
Each part is examined separately, then we multiply to get the final result.

We first identify the probability of a single sequence. One particular case is to first observe all the failures ($n-k$ of them) followed by the $k$ successes:
\begin{align*}
&P(\text{Single sequence}) \\
&= P(\text{$n-k$ failures and then $k$ successes}) \\
&= (1-p)^{n-k} p^{k}
\end{align*}

We must also identify the number of sequences for the general case. Above, ten sequences were identified where the fourth success came on the sixth attempt. These sequences were identified by fixing the last observation as a success and looking for all the ways to arrange the other observations. In other words, how many ways could we arrange $k-1$ successes in $n-1$ trials? This can be found using the $n$ choose $k$ coefficient but for $n-1$ and $k-1$ instead:
\begin{align*}
{n-1 \choose k-1} = \frac{(n-1)!}{(k-1)! \left((n-1) - (k-1)\right)!} = \frac{(n-1)!}{(k-1)! \left(n - k\right)!}
\end{align*}
This is the number of different ways we can order $k-1$ successes and $n-k$ failures in $n-1$ trials. If the factorial notation (the exclamation point) is unfamiliar, see page~\pageref{factorialDefinitionInTheBinomialSection}.

\begin{onebox}{Negative binomial distribution}
  The negative binomial distribution describes the
  probability of observing the $k^{th}$ success on
  the $n^{th}$ trial, where all trials are independent:
  \begin{align*}
  P(\text{the $k^{th}$ success on the $n^{th}$ trial})
      = {n-1 \choose k-1} p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}
  \end{align*}
  The value $p$ represents the probability that
  an individual trial is a success.
\end{onebox}

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{Show using the formula for the negative binomial distribution that the probability Brian kicks his fourth successful field goal on the sixth attempt is 0.164.}
The probability of a single success is $p=0.8$, the number of successes is $k=4$, and the number of necessary attempts under this scenario is $n=6$.
\begin{align*}
{n-1 \choose k-1}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}\ 
	=\ \frac{5!}{3!2!} (0.8)^4 (0.2)^2\ 
	=\ 10\times 0.0164\ 
	=\ 0.164
\end{align*}
\end{nexample}
\end{examplewrap}

\begin{exercisewrap}
\begin{nexercise}
The negative binomial distribution requires that each kick attempt by Brian is independent. Do you think it is reasonable to suggest that each of Brian's kick attempts are independent?\footnotemark
\end{nexercise}
\end{exercisewrap}
\footnotetext{Answers may vary. We cannot conclusively say they are or are not independent. However, many statistical reviews of athletic performance suggests such attempts are very nearly independent.}

\begin{exercisewrap}
\begin{nexercise}
Assume Brian's kick attempts are independent. What is the probability that Brian will kick his fourth field goal within 5 attempts?\footnotemark
\end{nexercise}
\end{exercisewrap}
\footnotetext{If his fourth field goal ($k=4$) is within five attempts, it either took him four or five tries ($n=4$ or $n=5$). We have $p=0.8$ from earlier. Use the negative binomial distribution to compute the probability of $n = 4$ tries and $n=5$ tries, then add those probabilities together:
\begin{align*}
& P(n=4\text{ OR }n=5) = P(n=4) + P(n=5) \\
&\quad = {4-1 \choose 4-1} 0.8^4 + {5-1 \choose 4-1} (0.8)^4(1-0.8) = 1\times 0.41 + 4\times 0.082 = 0.41 + 0.33 = 0.74
\end{align*}}

\begin{onebox}{Binomial versus negative binomial}
  In the binomial case, we typically have a fixed number
  of trials and instead consider the number of successes.
  In the negative binomial case, we examine how many trials
  it takes to observe a fixed number of successes and
  require that the last observation be a success.
\end{onebox}

\begin{exercisewrap}
\begin{nexercise}
On 70\% of days, a hospital admits at least one heart attack patient. On 30\% of the days, no heart attack patients are admitted. Identify each case below as a binomial or negative binomial case, and compute the probability.\footnotemark
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item What is the probability the hospital will admit
    a heart attack patient on exactly three days this week?

\item What is the probability the second day with a heart
    attack patient will be the fourth day of the week?

\item What is the probability the fifth day of next month
    will be the first day with a heart attack patient?
\end{enumerate}
\end{nexercise}
\end{exercisewrap}
\footnotetext{In each part, $p=0.7$. (a) The number of days is fixed, so this is binomial. The parameters are $k=3$ and $n=7$: 0.097. (b) The last ``success'' (admitting a heart attack patient) is fixed to the last day, so we should apply the negative binomial distribution. The parameters are $k=2$, $n=4$: 0.132. (c) This problem is negative binomial with $k=1$ and $n=5$: 0.006. Note that the negative binomial case when $k=1$ is the same as using the geometric distribution.}

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{There are about 8 million individuals
    in New York City.
    How many individuals might we expect to be hospitalized
    for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), i.e. a heart attack,
    each day?
    According to historical records, the average number is
    about 4.4 individuals.
    However, we would also like to know the approximate
    distribution of counts.
    What would a histogram of the number of AMI occurrences
    each day look like if we recorded the daily counts over
    an entire year?}
  \label{amiIncidencesEachDayOver1YearInNYCExample}%
  A histogram of the number of occurrences of AMI on 365 days
  for NYC is shown in
  Figure~\ref{amiIncidencesOver100Days}.\footnotemark{}
  The sample mean (4.38) is similar to the historical average
  of~4.4.
  The sample standard deviation is about 2, and the histogram
  indicates that about 70\% of the data fall between 2.4 and~6.4.
  The distribution's shape is unimodal and skewed to the right.
\end{nexample}
\end{examplewrap}
\footnotetext{These data are simulated. In practice, we should check for an association between successive days.}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \Figure{0.6}{amiIncidencesOver100Days}
  \caption{A histogram of the number of occurrences
      of AMI on 365 separate days in NYC.}
  \label{amiIncidencesOver100Days}
\end{figure}

The \termsub{Poisson distribution}{distribution!Poisson} is often useful for estimating the number of events in a large population over a unit of time. For instance, consider each of the following events:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item having a heart attack,
\item getting married, and
\item getting struck by lightning.
\end{itemize}
The Poisson distribution helps us describe the number of such events that will occur in a day for a fixed population if the individuals within the population are independent. The Poisson distribution could also be used over another unit of time, such as an hour or a~week.

The histogram in Figure~\ref{amiIncidencesOver100Days} approximates a Poisson distribution with rate equal to 4.4. The \term{rate} for a Poisson distribution is the average number of occurrences in a mostly-fixed population per unit of time. In Example~\ref{amiIncidencesEachDayOver1YearInNYCExample}, the time unit is a day, the population is all New York City residents, and the historical rate is 4.4. The parameter in the Poisson distribution is the rate -- or how many events we expect to observe -- and it is typically denoted by $\lambda$\index{Greek!lambda@lambda ($\lambda$)}
(the Greek letter \emph{lambda})  or $\mu$. Using the rate, we can describe the probability of observing exactly $k$ events in a single unit of time.

\begin{onebox}{Poisson distribution}
  Suppose we are watching for events and the number
  of observed events follows a Poisson distribution
  with rate $\lambda$.
  Then
  \begin{align*}
  P(\text{observe $k$ events})
      = \frac{\lambda^{k} e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
  \end{align*}
  where $k$ may take a value 0, 1, 2, and so on,
  and $k!$ represents $k$-factorial, as described on
  page~\pageref{factorialDefinitionInTheBinomialSection}.
  The letter $e\approx2.718$ is the base of the natural
  logarithm.
  The mean and standard deviation of this distribution
  are $\lambda$ and $\sqrt{\lambda}$, respectively.
\end{onebox}

We will leave a rigorous set of conditions for the Poisson distribution to a later course. However, we offer a few simple guidelines that can be used for an initial evaluation of whether the Poisson model would be appropriate.

A random variable may follow a Poisson distribution if we are looking for the number of events, the population that generates such events is large, and the events occur independently of each other.

Even when events are not really independent -- for instance, Saturdays and Sundays are especially popular for weddings -- a Poisson model may sometimes still be reasonable if we allow it to have a different rate for different times. In the wedding example, the rate would be modeled as higher on weekends than on weekdays. The idea of modeling rates for a Poisson distribution against a second variable such as \var{dayOfTheWeek} forms the foundation of some more advanced methods that fall in the realm of \termsub{generalized linear models}{generalized linear model}. In Chapters~\ref{linRegrForTwoVar} and~\ref{multipleAndLogisticRegression}, we will discuss a foundation of linear models.
