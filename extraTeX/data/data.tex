\chapter{Data sets within the text}
\label{appendix_data}

%A foundational principle that supports quality statistical
%analysis is well-organized data.

Each data set within the text is described in this appendix,
and there is a corresponding page for each of these data sets at
\oiRedirect{data}
    {\color{black}\textbf{openintro.org/data}}.
This page also includes additional data sets that can be
used for honing your skills.
Each data set has its own page with the following information:
\begin{itemize}
\item
    Description of each data set.
\item
    Detailed overview of each data set's variables.
\item
    CSV download.
\item
    R object file download.
\end{itemize}
Over time we will also expand the information available
on these pages.

\label{ch_foundations_for_inf_data}

\begin{itemize}
\item[\ref{pointEstimates}]
    [\datalink{pew\_energy\_2018}]
    The actual data has more observations than were referenced
    in this chapter.
    That is, we used a subsample since it helped smooth some
    of the examples to have a bit more variability.
    The \data{pew\us{}energy\us{}2018} data set represents
    the full data set for each of the different energy source
    questions, which covers solar, wind, offshore drilling,
    hydrolic fracturing, and nuclear energy.
    The statistics used to construct the data are from
    the following page:
    \begin{center}
    \oiRedirect{textbook-pew_2018_poll_on_solar_and_wind_expansion}
        {{\small{www.pewinternet.org/2018/05/14/majorities-see-government-efforts-to-protect-the-environment-as-insufficient/}}}

    [\datalink{ebola\_survey}]
    In New York City on October 23rd, 2014, a doctor who had
    recently been treating Ebola patients in Guinea went to
    the hospital with a slight fever and was subsequently
    diagnosed with Ebola.
    Soon thereafter, an NBC~4 New York/The Wall Street
    Journal/Marist Poll found that
    \wsjebolapollpercent{}\% of New Yorkers favored a
    ``mandatory 21-day quarantine for anyone who has come
    in contact with an Ebola patient''.
    This poll included responses of \wsjebolapollsizecomma{}
    New York adults between Oct 26th and~28th, 2014.

\item[\ref{hypothesisTesting}]
    [\datalink{pew\_energy\_2018}]
    See the details for this data set above
    in the Section~\ref{pointEstimates} data section.
\item[\ref{hypothesisTesting}]
    [Rosling questions]
    We noted much smaller samples than the Roslings'
    describe in their book,
    \oiRedirect{amazon_factfulness}{Factfulness},
    The samples we describe are similar but not
    the same as the actual rates.
    The approximate rates for the correct answers for the
    two questions for (sometimes different) populations
    discussed in the book, as reported in
    \oiRedirect{amazon_factfulness}{Factfulness},
    are
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
        Extreme poverty halved in the last 20 years:
        7\% get this correct.
        \oiRedirect{gapm-io-q3}{gapm.io/q3}
    \item
        Number of children in the world in 2100:
        9\% correct.
        \oiRedirect{gapm-io-q5}{gapm.io/q5}
    \end{itemize}
    Here are a few more questions and a rough percent
    of people who get them correct:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
        In all low-income countries across the world today,
        how many girls finish primary school: 20\%, 40\%, or 60\%?
        Answer: 60\%.
        About 7\% of people get this question correct.
        \oiRedirect{gapm-io-q1}{gapm.io/q1}
    \item
        What is the life expectancy of the world today:
        50 years, 60 years, or 70 years?
        Answer: 70 years.
        In the US, about 43\% of people get this question correct.
        \oiRedirect{gapm-io-q4}{gapm.io/q4}
    \item
        How many of the world's 1 year old children today
        have been vaccinated against some disease:
        20\%, 50\%, or 80\%?
        Answer: 80\%.
        About 13\% of people get this question correct.
        \oiRedirect{gapm-io-q9}{gapm.io/q9}
    \item
        In 1996, tigers, giant pandas, and black rhinos
        were all listed as endangered.
        How many of these three species are more
        critically endangered today:
        two of them,
        one of them,
        none of them?
        Answer: none of them.
        About 7\% of people get this question correct.
        \oiRedirect{gapm-io-q11}{gapm.io/q11}
    \item
        How many people in the world have some access
        to electricity? 20\%, 50\%, 80\%.
        Answer: 80\%.
        About 22\% of people get this correct.

\item[\ref{hypothesisTesting}]
    [\datalink{nuclear\_survey}]
    A simple random sample of 1,028 US adults in March 2013
    found that 56\% of US adults support nuclear arms reduction.
