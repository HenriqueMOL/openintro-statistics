\eoce{\qt{Cleveland vs. Sacramento\label{cleveland_sacramento}} Average income varies 
from one region of the country to another, and it often reflects both 
lifestyles and regional living expenses. Suppose a new graduate is considering 
a job in two locations, Cleveland, OH and Sacramento, CA, and he wants to see 
whether the average income in one of these cities is higher than the other. He 
would like to conduct a hypothesis test based on two small samples from the 
2000 Census, but he first must consider whether the conditions are met to 
implement the test. Below are histograms for each city. Should he move forward 
with the hypothesis test? Explain your reasoning. \\
