\eoce{\qt{Light and exam performance\label{light_exam_performance}} A study is designed to 
test the effect of light level on exam performance of students. The researcher believes 
that light levels might have different effects on males and females, so wants to make 
sure both are equally represented in each treatment. The treatments are fluorescent 
overhead lighting, yellow overhead lighting, no overhead lighting (only desk lamps). 
\begin{parts}
\item What is the response variable?
\item What is the explanatory variable? What are its levels?
\item What is the blocking variable? What are its levels?

\eoce{\qt{Vitamin supplements\label{vitamin_supplement}} In order to assess the effectiveness 
of taking large doses of vitamin C in reducing the duration of the common cold, 
researchers recruited 400 healthy volunteers from staff and students at a university. A 
quarter of the patients were assigned a placebo, and the rest were evenly divided 
between 1g Vitamin C,  3g Vitamin C, or 3g Vitamin C plus additives to be taken at onset 
of a cold for the following two days. All tablets had identical appearance and packaging.
The nurses who handed the prescribed pills to the patients knew which patient received 
which treatment, but the researchers assessing the patients when they were sick did not. 
No significant differences were observed in any measure of cold duration or severity 
between the four medication groups, and the placebo group had the shortest duration of 
symptoms.\footfullcite{Audera:2001}
\begin{parts}
\item Was this an experiment or an observational study? Why?
\item What are the explanatory and response variables in this study?
\item Were the patients blinded to their treatment?
\item Was this study double-blind?
\item Participants are ultimately able to choose whether or not to use the pills 
prescribed to them. We might expect that not all of them will adhere and take their 
pills. Does this introduce a confounding variable to the study? Explain your reasoning.

\eoce{\qt{Light, noise, and exam performance\label{light_noise_exam_performance}} A study is 
designed to test the effect of light level and noise level on exam performance of 
students. The researcher believes that light and noise levels might have different 
effects on males and females, so wants to make sure both are equally represented in each 
treatment. The light treatments considered are fluorescent overhead lighting, yellow 
overhead lighting, no overhead lighting (only desk lamps). The noise treatments 
considered are no noise,  construction noise, and human chatter noise.
\begin{parts}
\item What type of study is this?
\item How many factors are considered in this study? Identify them, and describe their 
levels.
\item What is the role of the sex variable in this study?

\eoce{\qt{Exercise and mental health\label{exercise_mental_health}} A researcher is interested 
in the effects of exercise on mental health and he proposes the following study: Use 
stratified random sampling to ensure representative proportions of 18-30, 31-40 and 41-
55 year olds from the population. Next, randomly assign half the subjects from each age 
group to exercise twice a week, and instruct the rest not to exercise. Conduct a mental 
health exam at the beginning and at the end of the study, and compare the results.
\begin{parts}
\item What type of study is this? 
\item What are the treatment and control groups in this study?
\item Does this study make use of blocking? If so, what is the blocking variable?
\item Does this study make use of blinding?
\item Comment on whether or not the results of the study can be used to establish a 
causal relationship between exercise and mental health, and indicate whether or not the 
conclusions can be generalized to the population at large.
\item Suppose you are given the task of determining if this proposed study should get 
funding. Would you have any reservations about the study proposal?

\eoce{\qt{Chia seeds and weight loss\label{chia_weight_lostt}} Chia Pets -- those terra-cotta 
figurines that sprout fuzzy green hair -- made the chia plant a household name. But chia 
has gained an entirely new reputation as a diet supplement.  In one 2009 study, a team 
of researchers recruited 38 men and divided them randomly into two groups: treatment or 
control. They also recruited 38 women, and they randomly placed half of these 
participants into the treatment group and the other half into the control group. One 
group was given 25 grams of chia seeds twice a day, and the other was given a placebo. 
The subjects volunteered to be a part of the study. After 12 weeks, the scientists found 
no significant difference between the groups in appetite or weight loss.

\eoce{\qt{GPA and study hours\label{gpa_study_hours}} A survey was conducted on 193 
Duke University undergraduates who took an introductory statistics course in 
2012. Among many other questions, this survey asked them about their GPA, which 
can range between 0 and 4 points, and the number of hours they spent studying 
per week. The scatterplot below displays the relationship between these two 
variables.

\eoce{\qt{City council survey\label{city_council_survey}} A city council has requested a 
household survey be conducted in a suburban area of their city. The area is broken 
into many distinct and unique neighborhoods, some including large homes, some with 
only apartments, and others a diverse mixture of housing structures. Identify the 
sampling methods described below, and comment on whether or not you think they 
would be effective in this setting.
\begin{parts}
\item Randomly sample 50 households from the city.
\item Divide the city into neighborhoods, and sample 20 households from each 
neighborhood.
\item Divide the city into neighborhoods, randomly sample 10 neighborhoods, 
and sample all households from those neighborhoods.
\item Divide the city into neighborhoods, randomly sample 10 neighborhoods, 
and then randomly sample 20 households from those neighborhoods.

\item Students at an elementary school are given a questionnaire that they 
are asked to return after their parents have completed it. One of the questions 
asked is, ``Do you find that your work schedule makes it difficult for you to 
spend time with your kids after school?" Of the parents who replied, 85\% said 
``no". Based on these results, the school officials conclude that a great 
majority of the parents have no difficulty spending time with their kids 
after school.
\item A survey is conducted on a simple random sample of 1,000 women who 
recently gave birth, asking them about whether or not they smoked during 
pregnancy. A follow-up survey asking if the children have respiratory problems 
is conducted 3 years later, however, only 567 of these women are reached at the 
same address. The researcher reports that these 567 women are representative 
of all mothers.
\item An orthopedist administers a questionnaire to 30 of his patients who do 
not have any joint problems and finds that 20 of them regularly go running. 
He concludes that running decreases the risk of joint problems.

\eoce{\qt[?]{Eat better, feel better\label{eat_better_feel_better}} In a public health 
study on the effects of consumption of fruits and vegetables on psychological 
well-being in young adults, participants were randomly assigned to three 
groups: (1) diet-as-usual, (2) an ecological momentary intervention involving 
text message reminders to increase their fruits and vegetable consumption plus 
a voucher to purchase them, or (3) a fruit and vegetable intervention in 
which participants were given two additional daily servings of fresh fruits and 
vegetables to consume on top of their normal diet. Participants were asked to 
report on their psychological well-being with a nightly survey they took on 
their smart phones. Participants were student volunteers at the University of 
Otago, New Zealand. At the end of the 14-day study, only participants in the third 
group improvements to their psychological well-being across the 14-days relative 
to the other groups.\footfullcite{conner2017let}

\item A newspaper article reporting on the study states "The results of this 
study provide proof that giving young adults fresh fruit and vegetables to eat 
can have psychological benefits, even over a brief period of time." How would you 
suggest revising this statement so that it can be supported by the study?

\eoce{\qt{Screens, teens, and psychological well-being\label{screen_time_well_being}} 
In a study of three nationally representative large-scale data sets from Ireland, 
the United States, and the United Kingdom (n = 17,247), teenagers between the 
ages of 12 to 15 were asked to keep a diary of their screen time and answer 
a series of questions about how they felt or acted. The answers to these questions 
were then used to compute a psychological well-being score. Additionally data were 
collected on child’s sex and age and the mother’s education, ethnicity, 
psychological distress, and employment were included in the analysis. 
The study concluded that there is little clear-cut evidence that screen time 
decreases adolescent.
